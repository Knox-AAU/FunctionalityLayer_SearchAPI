# SEARCH ENGINE
This project is a part of the Knox multiproject on AAU, and is located in layer four. The goal is to create functionality within Knox, by making the information queryable through a search engine, and eventually, a virtual assistant.  
This module receives queries and compares these queries to the documents in the Knox database. It ranks documents and returns the most relevant information to the user. 

## WIKI
The search engine is documented in the [wiki](https://wiki.knox.cs.aau.dk/Search-engine/GruppeG).

## Opening the Project
The project is structured as a Maven project. To open the project in IntelliJ, clone the repository from Github, open IntelliJ and under File->Open, navigate to the Knox16_G repo. Select pom.xml and open this file. Maven should make sure the project opens correctly, and deal with any missing dependencies. If this fails, right-click pom.xml inside IntelliJ and under Maven, select Reload project.
